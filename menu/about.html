and I received a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 from the <a href="https://www.unimi.it/it">University of Milan</a>.<br></p>

<p>Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Milan.
My supervisor is Professor <a href="https://mereghetti.di.unimi.it/">Carlo Mereghetti</a>.<br></p>

<p>My main research interests are:
    <ul>
        <li>quantum computing</li>
        <li>formal language</li>

    </ul>
</p>

I am one of the organisers of <a href="https://musemi.di.unimi.it">MuseMI</a>, a series of seminars organised for Phd computer science students, by Phd computer science students in the University of Milan.
